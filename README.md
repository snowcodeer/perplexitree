# perplexitree - AI-Powered Knowledge Tree Game

Live at: https://perplexitree-amcashh84-natalies-projects-e84f005c.vercel.app/

A beautiful, interactive web game that combines the meditative puzzle mechanics of "Prune" with AI-powered knowledge exploration. Players grow knowledge trees by pruning branches while leveraging the Perplexity API to discover unique, real-time information on any topic. Each growth session returns fresh, non-redundant search results to build comprehensive understanding.

## Project Summary

**Purpose**: perplexitree transforms learning into an engaging, visual experience where users cultivate knowledge trees through strategic pruning and AI-enhanced exploration. The game addresses information overload by presenting unique, curated insights through an intuitive tree metaphor.

**Technical Approach**: Built with a modular architecture featuring FastAPI backend and vanilla JavaScript frontend, the application integrates Perplexity's real-time search capabilities to generate unique knowledge areas for each growth session. The system ensures non-redundant information retrieval through intelligent query generation and structured output parsing.

**Perplexity API Integration**: The game leverages Perplexity's reasoning and retrieval capabilities through a two-phase approach:
- **Initial Search**: Uses Perplexity's `sonar-pro` chat completion model with structured JSON output to generate 5 unique knowledge areas from the initial query
- **Subsequent Growth**: Uses Perplexity's search model with negative prompting to find unique web results for each new branch
- **Flashcard Generation**: Uses `sonar-pro` chat completion to create study materials from search results
- **Unique Results**: Negative prompting system ensures each growth session returns fresh, non-redundant information

The integration ensures players receive diverse, comprehensive information while maintaining the game's meditative, focused learning experience.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Knowledge Tree**: Grow branches that represent real search results from Perplexity API
- **Interactive Tools**: 7 different tools for managing your knowledge tree
- **Unique Search Results**: Each growth session returns fresh, non-redundant information
- **Study System**: Create flashcards from search results for enhanced learning
- **Visual Progression**: Transform knowledge into flowers and fruits
- **Game State Persistence**: Save and load your knowledge trees

## Game Mechanics

### Tools Available
1. **Growth Tool**: Click on nodes to grow new branches with search results
2. **Cut Tool**: Click and drag to prune unwanted branches
3. **Leaves Tool**: Create flashcards from search results on branches
4. **Flower Tool**: Add flowers to branch ends (knowledge blossoming)
5. **Fruit Tool**: Transform flowers into apples (fruit of labor)
6. **Reposition Tool**: Drag branch ends to move and resize branches
7. **Study Tool**: Hover over nodes to view search result details
8. **Pan Tool**: Drag to move around the view

### Core Gameplay
1. **Start**: Enter a search query to begin growing your knowledge tree
2. **Grow**: Use the growth tool to expand branches with AI-powered search results
3. **Prune**: Cut away branches that don't contribute to your learning goals
4. **Study**: Create flashcards and study materials from your search results
5. **Progress**: Watch your knowledge tree evolve with flowers and fruits
